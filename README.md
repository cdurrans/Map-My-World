# Map My World
Robotics Nanodegree Map My World Project

For this project I implemented RTAB-SLAM into my existing robot and home world. It has been interesting to play with and I'm planning to add features to my home to see if it performs better. It seems to struggle with my open doorways. I also got stuck on the wall once and I wonder if the incorrect path and map dimensions below are a result of getting stuck. I'm still learning!
